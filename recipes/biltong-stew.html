            <h2>Traditional South African Biltong Stew</h2>
            <p class="description">Biltong is a much loved South African delicacy made with dry-cured beef or game meat and flavored with spices such as whole coriander seeds.</p>
            <p class="description">It is quite typical to use dried meat or biltong with a little peanut butter to make a stew. The addition of peanut butter to enrich the stew is most likely done because the meat is not normally affordable, therefore another source of protein is sought to supplement that which would have otherwise been consumed from the meat.</p>
            <p class="description">Making this stew is easy because all of the ingredients can be consumed as is, therefore not much cooking time is required. This is best served with polenta and a side of green vegetables. Traditionally, it is served with sadza (Sadza is a traditional porridge originating from Zimbabwe, consisting of cornmeal and water) and cabbage as pictured.</p>
